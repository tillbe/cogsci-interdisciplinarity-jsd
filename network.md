Below, we plotted the collaboration network(s) in *Cognitive Science*. Each node is an author, and each edge between two authors represents a collaboration between these authors. Hover over a node to see the average JSD of the author, and hover over an edge to see the JSD between the two authors. You can select specific authors in the dropdown on the left, which will highlight the author node and immediate neighbors. The nodes are draggable and you can zoom in and out using your mousewheel, so feel free to play around a little!
