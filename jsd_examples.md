This page shows three different collaborations, with a low, medium and high JSD respecitively. You can select the distribution in the panel on the left. The panel on the right then shows the respective distributions, i.e. each point on the $x$-axis represents a journal, and the value on the $y$-axis shows often an author has published in that journal. This way, you can get an easy impression of the shared publication history of the two authors. The differences between the three collaborations should be clear immediately.

For more information on the JSD formula, please see the appendix in our paper.
